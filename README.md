This application aims at connecting people who share a common love for traveling.The app helps you find a travel mate with whom you can decide to divide your travel expenses with or share rides as is your preference.

All the user have to do is make an account and select the place you would like to visit next and our algorithm will do all the work.Anyone from experienced users to those with slim to no experience with apps shouldn't have any difficulty navigating through the app's interface.You could decide to create a new account or login with your google-plus or facebook account.After your account is set up you'll be given the option to add places to your travel list.We'll match you up with people in or around your locality who've the same destination in their travel list as yours. You can then select to follow the ones that you prefer .Once you follow you'll have the option to chat with them so as to decide whether or not you'd like to travel with them and if yes, then decide how to share expenses or the mode of transport and such.

May be traveling together will make us realize we're not all that different from each other despite our preconceived notions about others.
